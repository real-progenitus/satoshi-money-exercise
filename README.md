This app was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the simplicity it brings for fetching data in the same server that the app is running instead of running a node.js server separately.

All the pages in the application are Server Side Rendered.

This project is using Binance as the source of data because it doesn't require an API key which simplifies the security steps needed to share secret API keys outside of github.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies of the project

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server using one of the following:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
