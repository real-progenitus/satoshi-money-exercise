This app was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the simplicity it brings for fetching data in the same server that the app is running instead of running a node.js server separately.

All the pages in the application are Server Side Rendered.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies of the project

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server using one of the following:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
